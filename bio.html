	<p> I was born on October 5th 1995 in Concord Massachusetts.  I  went to highschool at Concord-Carlisle Regional High School.
	When I was there I developed an interest in math and science which led to my desire to pursue engineering at college.  While at high school I also played golf, skied, and played ultimate frisbee.  I currently go to Tufts University where I am studying computer science through the school of engineering and minoring in economics.  Here at Tufts I am on the ultimate frisbee team as well as many other organizations as highlighted in my resume. </p>
